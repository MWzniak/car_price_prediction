# car_price_prediction

!! Some things in this notebook aren't neccessary when creating a model (like the normality test on every variable). Please bear in mind that everything thats in the notebook was a mandatory part of a university assignment. !!

This notebook is a cleaned and reduced version of code I used to complete my university assignment - create and document econometric (OLS) model. I decided to explain the pricing of used cars in my motherland, Poland. There are some cool plots and statistical test. There are also 5 different OLS models created with statsmodels. The final model is being graphically diagnosed with a cool package lmdiag.
